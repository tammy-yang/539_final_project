      <p>Hi, my name is Tammy. I had my summer internship in Utah in 2023, and that was one of my most amazing summer. I visited several national parks and state parks in Utah, went hiking, camping, and paddleboarding. That summer was incredible and unforgettable, so I decided to jot them down as memory!</p>
      <p>The beauty of Utah was beyond my imagination. Utah is a nature and outdoor wonderland with five well-known national parks. Only Alaska and California have more National parks than Utah. They are usually called Utah's mighty five: Bryce Canyon, Zion, Arches, Capitol Reef, and Canyonlands. These National parks are among the most visited and photographed in the worlds</p>
      <p>The information is from nps.gov and the photos were taken by me.</p>
